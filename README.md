# MyExpenses
The idea of creating this APIRest was for control reasons, where I want to build a shared expense system, where the individual can connect, manage his expenses, and even adapt those of another user such as his wife or children, and be able to see the expense of each

## Apps
To consume the data you must go through the login and generate the token, to be able to enter the API, one account cannot access another, to generate users, normally, anyone can register accounts, and each account will have its space . consuming and creating data

## Record
### User:
Will be able to register, they will be able to connect, and they will be able to generate their expenses with their statistics
### Categories: 
Refers to types of purchases such as Supermarket, among others.

### Expenses: 
It refers to how much expenses we have, this is a list that will contain products for each list.

### Product: 
it will have a name, count and price, and it can be previewed, for example, calculating in the supermarket and while you do it and `finish` you spend the total production of your own account
